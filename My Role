Details my dual role as a designer and team lead—highlighting how I facilitated collaboration, mentored peers, and resolved feature disagreements to ensure delivery of a cohesive product.

2. Team Size: 7 designers across two schools (Seidenberg School of Computer Science & Haub Law)

Responsibilities:

2. Mentored junior designers (4) on wireframing best practices and usability heuristics.

3. Coordinated cross‑disciplinary reviews with legal experts and developers.

4. Drove the final UI toolkit, ensuring accessibility (AA standard) and responsive consistency.
