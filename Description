Welcome to the Access to Justice (A2J) UX/UI design project repository. This document outlines the product launch details, design process, team contributions, and final deliverables for the A2J web platform, aimed at empowering tenants in Westchester County to advocate for their housing rights.

In this project, we applied human-centered design to build a socially impactful platform from the ground up. Below is a quick preview of how we approached the challenge and what we delivered:

1. Led a multi-disciplinary team of designers and legal experts

2. Built scalable wireframes and interactive flows for critical features like record keeping, analytics, and community messaging

3. Conducted user testing that directly informed interface refinements

4. Navigated collaboration challenges through leadership and clear vision
