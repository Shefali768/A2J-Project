Walks through our full design lifecycle—from research to UI delivery—capturing the structured steps we followed to ensure a user-centered and iterative approach.

A) Discovery and Research:
1. Conducted 15 user interviews with Westchester tenants to map pain points.

2. Performed competitive analysis on housing‑justice platforms.

B) Ideation & Requirements:

1. Facilitated 3 co‑creation workshops to define feature set and user flows.

2. Created personas and empathy maps to guide solution focus.

C) Wireframing & Prototyping:

1. Designed low‑fidelity wireframes in Figma; iterated through 4 rounds based on stakeholder feedback.

2. Developed high‑fidelity prototypes for desktop and mobile (Figma Interactive).

D) Usability Testing:

1. Conducted 2 usability test sessions with 12 participants; captured 30+ qualitative insights.

2. Refined interactions (e.g., letter‑creation workflow reduced from 7 steps to 4).

E) Final UI & Handoff:

1. Delivered a UI component library (Figma) with tokens for color, typography, and spacing.

2. Generated Zeplin specs for React development team, accelerating frontend implementation by 25%.
